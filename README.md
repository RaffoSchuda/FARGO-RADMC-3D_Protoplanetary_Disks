# Run_RADMC3D_From_Python
This code was developed for running model examples of RADMC3D from Python, in this case we used Jupyter Notebook. This is just the first step for creating a more generalized code that allows the user to search any directory on the computer, change to that directory and work with it from Python.
At least for now, it works only on Linux.
